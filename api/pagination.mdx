Pagination endpoints come with a `pagination` payload. The payload contains various pieces of metadata about the resource:
- **current**: The current page
- **previous**: The previous page
- **next**: The next page
- **limit**: The maximum records per page
- **total_pages**: The total numbers of pages
- **total_count**: The total number of records

## Example
```
{
  "data": [
    // an array of the resource you are accessing
  ],
  "paginiation": {
    "current": 1,
    "previous": null,
    "next": 2,
    "limit": 100,
    "total_pages": 1000,
    "total_count": 10000
  }
}
```
