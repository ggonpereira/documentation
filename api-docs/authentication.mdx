description: "How to authenticate with the Fuse API"
---

To access the Fuse API, you need to [create an API key](https://fuse.flatirons.com/account/developers) in the Developers section of your account.

In each request you send to Fuse, you should send an API key from your account using [Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/). 

To do this, include the following header in your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
