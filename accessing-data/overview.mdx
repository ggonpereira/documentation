There are two recommended ways to get data from Fuse into your system: 
- the API (pull)
- Record webhooks (push)

If your importer has Incognito mode enabled, the API and webhooks are unavailable. See [instructions](/access-data/incognito-mode) for accessing data with Incognito enabled.

## **API Access**

For many situations, accessing import data [via the API](/accessing-data/api-access) is the best way to get data out of Fuse and into your own database.

API access can be used in conjunction with [Status Webhooks](/accessing-data/status-webhooks) to get into your system right after it has been uploaded.

### **When to use the API**

The API is typically the best option if you do not need the data in your system at the time when the user closes out of their Importer.

## **Record Webhooks**

[Record Webhooks](/accessing-data/record-webhooks) are processed **in real time** as the user is submitting an import. 

### **When to use Record Webhooks**

Record webhooks are best in two scenarios:

1. When your system needs data added to your database in real-time as the user imports it
2. When you wish to communicate backend data validation issues to the user
