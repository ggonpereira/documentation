The records associated with an Import can be retried from the API. There are two relevant API requests:
1. [List Imports](/apis/resources/imports/list-imports), to get a list of all Imports
2. [Import Records](/apis/resources/records/import-records), to get the records associated with a specific Import

To get notified when a new Import is available, use a [Status Webhook](/accessing-data/status-webhooks).
