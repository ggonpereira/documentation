You can add a column in two different ways:

1. Through the UI in your account.
2. Directly in code.

For developers, adding columns in code will be faster. You can add columns in code using the `addColumn` function.

## `addColumn`

<Note>
  **Important**: Because each column type has different options, you should
  refer to the documentation for a specific column type to understand how to use
  `addColumn`. For example, see the [`String Column
  documentation`](/using-columns/string-columns).
