<Note>
**Each column type in Fuse has built-in data transformations.** There is a lot you can do out of the box.

Because each column type has different built-in data transformations, you should **refer to the documentation of a specific column type** to see the available options.

</Note>

When the built-in transformations are not enough for you, you can create your own custom data transformations using the `formatRecord` hook.

## `formatRecord(record)`

The `formatRecord` hook is called for every row in the importer. It allows you to auto-format, correct issues, and more.

Here are some samples of things you might want to do with this hook:

- Capitalize all of the values in a column.
- Prepend "https://" to all of the URLs in a column.
- Automatically combine multiple uploaded fields into one column.

The `record` passed to this hook is an object that represents a single row in the importer. You can access the properties of the record using the `internal_key` of each column.

## Example

```javascript
importer.formatRecord = (record) => {
  const newRecord = { ...record };

  // capitalize the first letter in first_name
  if (typeof newRecord.first_name === "string") {
    newRecord.first_name =
      newRecord.first_name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() +
      newRecord.first_name.slice(1);
  }

  return newRecord;
};
```
