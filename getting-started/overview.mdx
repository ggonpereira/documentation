This first step when using Fuse is to setup an Importer. You can [create an Importer](/getting-started/creating-an-importer) from within your Fuse account.

To make a fully functional Importer, you should:
1. [Add columns](/getting-started/adding-columns), which represent the data schema your system supports. Make sure to [add validations](/getting-started/adding-data-validations) and [transformations](/getting-started/adding-data-transformations) to your columns.
2. [Embed your importer](/getting-started/embedding), if you wish for people to use it within your website.
3. [Access imported data](/accessing-data/overview) via the API or webhook.
